- There are multiple workspaces in this repository created to understand the concepts of web development followed by the deployment of the application in the Google Cloud.
- The course has helped me clear a lot of concepts and helped me to align practical experience with theoretical concepts.

### Project Description

1. CentralisedConfiguration
```
This project includes concepts related to centralising a configuration using a simple folder of .properties files
```
2. LoadBalancerEureka
```
This project demonstrates the usage of a Eureka Naming server and a load balancer for creating scalable applications
```
3. SpringBootBasic
```
All the basic content of a Spring Boot Application is experimented with in this project including basic Java Concepts (OOPS Concepts) and usage of data structures
```

Moto of this repository is to get a clear idea of designing a web application based on Spring Boot and technically go through the concepts.
